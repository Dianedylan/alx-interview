0x01. Lockboxes

You have <mark>n</mark> number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from <mark>0</mark>  to <mark>n - 1</mark>  and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

*Prototype: <mark>def canUnlockAll(boxes)</mark> 
*<mark>boxes</mark> is a list of lists
*A key with the same number as a box opens that box
* You can assume all keys will be positive integers
*There can be keys that do not have boxes
*The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
*Return <mark>True</mark>  if all boxes can be opened, else return <mark>False</mark>
